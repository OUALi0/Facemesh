# Real-time Face Mesh Detection and Drawing with React and TensorFlow.js

Welcome to the Real-time Face Mesh Detection and Drawing project! This project utilizes the power of React, TensorFlow.js, and FaceMesh to detect faces in real-time through your webcam and draw a mesh overlay on top of them.

## Overview

In today's digital age, real-time face detection and manipulation have become increasingly popular for various applications, ranging from virtual try-on experiences to augmented reality filters. This project explores the capabilities of modern web technologies to achieve real-time face mesh detection and drawing directly in the browser.

## How it Works

Using React as our frontend framework and TensorFlow.js as our machine learning library, we create a seamless web application that interacts with the user's webcam. Leveraging the FaceMesh model provided by TensorFlow.js, we detect facial landmarks and draw a mesh overlay on top of the detected face in real-time.

## Features

- **Real-time Face Detection**: Utilize your webcam to detect faces in real-time directly within your browser.
- **Face Mesh Drawing**: Once a face is detected, the application draws a mesh overlay on top of the face, highlighting facial landmarks.
- **Interactive Interface**: The user-friendly interface allows for easy interaction and exploration of the face mesh detection capabilities.

## Getting Started

To get started with the project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Install the necessary dependencies by running `npm install`.
3. Start the development server by running `npm start`.
4. Open your browser and navigate to the provided URL to view the application.
5. Grant permission to access your webcam if prompted.
6. Witness the magic of real-time face mesh detection and drawing!

## Technologies Used

- **React**: A popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **TensorFlow.js**: A JavaScript library for training and deploying machine learning models in the browser and on Node.js.
- **FaceMesh**: A pre-trained machine learning model provided by TensorFlow.js for detecting facial landmarks.
